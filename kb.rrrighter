As with building a house, you can either build your dream house‚Äîexpense be hanged‚Äîor you can build to a budget. If you want to build to a budget, you have to be very flexible about the product characteristics. Whether you build to a budget or not, software development is a process of gradual refinement, so some imprecision is unavoidable. Unlike building a home, in software the only way to refine the product concept and thereby the estimate is to actually build the software. Estimates can be refined over the course of a project. Promise your customer that you will provide more refined estimates at each stage."
